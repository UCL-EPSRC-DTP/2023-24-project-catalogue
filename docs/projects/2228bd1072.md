Project Summary:

Aim: To develop activity-based sustainability models that can be used to analyse policies and infrastructure investments by simulating how households adapt their behaviour and lifestyles in response to proposed changes. 
 
 Expected impact: This research will help the UK achieve its ambitious sustainability goals by enabling data-driven policymaking; quantifying the comprehensive impacts of diverse policies and investments and using artificial intelligence to identify new opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint. This will advance the state-of-the-art in sustainability analysis, where urban systems are considered only at an aggregated, macro-level, to enable fully disaggregated, agent-based sustainability simulations
 
 State-of-research: Activity-based transport models, which consider transport demand as resulting from peopleâ€™s need to partake in activities outside the home, are a key focus in both research and practice. We are currently working on new activity-based models of interconnected energy and transport demand that i) model multi-day activity scheduling from behavioural first principals, ii) explicitly capture the trade-offs between performing activities in-home or out-of-home, and iii) account for complex interactions between household members. This has resulted in the creation of several open-source research tools that will support this thesis, including an optimisation-based activity scheduling model (OASIS) and a deep-learning approach for creating detailed synthetic populations (DATGAN).
 
 Objectives: This PhD will extend our ongoing research across two related thrusts:
 1. Incorporating key socio-economic activities that impact lifestyle sustainability, including purchasing habits, use of home-delivery services, and consumption of online services and data, into multi-day, household activity schedules. Crucially, where possible, these activities will be predicted from behavioural first principles, which will therefore enable key sustainability indicators (e.g. annual household carbon footprint) to be quantified through simulation of diverse proposed interventions.
 2. Applying reinforcement learning approaches to identify low-hanging fruit - straightforward steps (both bottom-up behaviour changes and top-down policies) that have a positive impact on lifestyle sustainability.
