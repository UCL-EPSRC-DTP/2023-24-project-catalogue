Project Summary:

Active learning has originated as a subfield of machine learning that is used when data is expensive or difficult to obtain: Rather than randomly labelling all data, an algorithm chooses informative data points about which it is uncertain and requests a label from a human. This approach has been applied to healthcare in some clinical tests. For example, in the audiogram, a test to detect the softest tones a patient can hear, a Bayesian active-learning algorithm led to a more detailed threshold estimate in less time. The latter is particularly important for more complex tests, where test duration was shortened from several hours to 30 minutes, making them applicable in clinical practice.
 
 The active-learning approaches of those tests were hand-tailored and determined in extensive research. A key goal of the present project is to design and evaluate an active-learning framework based on Gaussian Processes with (hyper)parameter settings that are both general and robust enough to work for any test or experiment that
 - shows correlations between independent variables and/or
 - shows a linear or distance-based correlation along the scale of at least one independent variable.
 It will be evaluated with tests in vision and hearing.
 A second key goal will be to analyse tasks (Yes/No, Go/No go, n-alternatives correct/wrong) in an information-theoretic context, and let an algorithm automatically choose the most suitable task based on error rate, bias and expected information.
 
 The student will have a background in psychological methods or machine learning and will be trained in the other field by the supervisors. They will have the opportunity to extend the approach to an area of their interest as a third goal, for example to electrophysiological tests. Collaborations with other young researchers and activities like seminars will contribute to establishing a basic knowledge in speech, hearing and perception.
