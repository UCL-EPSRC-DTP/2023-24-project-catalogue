Project Summary:

Why this research is important
 
 RNA-based medicine has attracted tremendous attention for its diverse therapeutic potential. The major barrier to the translation of RNA therapy from bench to bedside is delivery - to bring the therapeutic RNA to the site of actions in a safe, effective and reproducible manner. RNA is notoriously unstable and cannot permeate through cell membrane. A delivery system is needed to protect RNAs from premature degradation and to promote uptake of RNA to the target cells. 
 
 Lung diseases such as respiratory infection, asthma and lung cancer are enormous global health burden. While RNAs are powerful molecules with huge potential for the treatment of these diseases, their administration is limited to parenteral injection, which is invasive and has a poor distribution to the lung. In contrast, pulmonary delivery can increase RNA concentration in the lung to enhance efficacy in a non-invasive manner while minimising systemic exposure and side-effects. This project aims to develop a pulmonary delivery platform for RNA therapeutics for the treatment of lung diseases. Microfluidic and particle engineering technologies will be employed for scalable production of aerosol formulations with prolonged stability. 
 
 
 What you will be doing
 
 This is a cross-disciplinary PhD project between the School of Pharmacy and Department of Mechanical Engineering at UCL to investigate the use of microfluidic and particle engineering techniques to develop a safe, effective and reproducible RNA delivery system as dry powder aerosol for the treatment of lung diseases. A novel synthetic peptide-based system will be used as RNA carrier. The aims of the project include (i) to establish an effective method to control the self-assembly of peptide/RNA complexes; (ii) to design and optimise RNA powder formulations with good stability and aerosolisation properties; and (iii) to evaluate the transfection efficiency, safe and pharmacokinetic profile of the optimsied RNA formulations.
