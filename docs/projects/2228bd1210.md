Project Summary:

The project's focus is on the design and analysis on finite element methods for compressible flows. The novelty is methods that are robust both for high and low Mach number and that can be proven to yield an accurate approximation in the smooth zone, away from strong nonlinearities. This is of particular interest for complex flow problems featuring shocks, turbulence, or combustion of great practical interest in science and technology.
