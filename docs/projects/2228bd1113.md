Project Summary:

Numerous materials in nature and industry (e.g. muds, pastes, emulsions and granular slurries) exhibit non-Newtonian ‘viscoplastic’ behaviour: they flow like a viscous fluid under sufficient force, but clog and jam if the applied stress is below a critical ‘yield’ value. There is an increasing understanding that such materials often also exhibit more complex time-dependent behaviour: their rheology actually evolves over time under different conditions towards one - or more - equilibrium states. This behaviour can cause unexpected and dramatic effects in the flows of these materials that are not fully understood. 
 
 The aims of this project are to assess and systematise the disparate array of models that have been proposed to account for this behaviour; to explore their predictions in different canonical flow settings; and so to better understand the mechanics of these materials. There may be the opportunity to apply findings directly to models of flowing mud or industrial waste. The project will involve mathematical modelling, applied analysis and some numerical simulation. The PhD student should have a background in applied mathematics, but there is no other requirement besides enthusiasm and interest.
