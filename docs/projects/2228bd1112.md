Project Summary:

Consider a single photon living in curved space. It is described by Maxwellâ€™s equations. We seek solutions harmonic in time. This reduces to the spectral problem for the operator curl, whose spectrum is, in general, asymmetric about zero (think particle/antiparticle). 
 
 Spectral asymmetry is a classical subject in analysis and geometry, whose origins lie in the papers of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer. The project will provide a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques developed in a series of recent joint papers by Matteo Capoferri and myself.
