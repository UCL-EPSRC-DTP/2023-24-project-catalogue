Project Summary:

This project will integrate cutting-edge concepts in artificial intelligence to enable personalized and adaptative treatment for non-small cell lung cancer radiotherapy patients. The solution will combine multi-inputs patient data (anatomical map, functional map, dynamic variations, biological information, treatment type) with artificial intelligence to relate the patient data to multiple outputs (predicted outcome, patientsâ€™ stratification for a clinical trial, robust treatment constraints). These outputs will then become part of a treatment-decision platform.
