Project Summary:

Various established neuroimaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), have been successfully applied across neuroscience and clinical research. However, the limitations of these technologies such as their fixed location, high cost, and patient discomfort inhibits applications to certain patient groups (e.g. babies, small children, the elderly) and prevents use outside of a hospital environment.
 
 The aim of this PhD project is to develop a new generation of intelligent, wearable, photonic imaging & sensing technology, which can provide effective diagnosis and long-term, regular monitoring for patients and users in almost any environments. Multiple novel photonic imaging technologies including Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) will be implemented and then integrated with other popular imaging modality, i.e. electroencephalography (EEG), on a miniaturized, intelligent, modular photonic imaging platform. This modular platform is expected to lead to wide-reaching applications in neurological diseases (e.g. dementia, epilepsy), behavioural disorders (e.g. autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), brain-computer interface, and personalized at-home healthcare.
  
 During this PhD project, the student will exploit advanced engineering approaches including photonic electronics, microchip design, AI enabled pre-processing, and wearable electronics to realise a sophisticated photonic imaging platform that will enable the creation of a range of devices that will offer unprecedented spatial-temporal resolution and patient comfort. 
 
 Key engineering methods utilized in this project are including:
 1)Modular DOT Design
 2)Dry EEG Electrodes
 3)AI-enabled Pre-Processing Unit
 4)Wearable Electronics
 
 The PhD student will gain substantial knowledge in fields such as photonics, medical electronics & microchip, optical imaging, AI processing, and wearable technologies, and will learn various useful skills such as circuit design, AI programming, microcontroller design, data analysis. These knowledge and skills will be applicable in a wide range of future careers for the student.
