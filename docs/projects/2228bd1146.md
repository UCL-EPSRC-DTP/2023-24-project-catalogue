Project Summary:

Why this research is important
 mRNA vaccines have reached the spotlight during the Covid-19 pandemic, as the forefront technology used for the development of vaccines by many companies. These vaccines are simple, very efficient and are now demonstrating therapeutic applications to other diseases. The production process is simple and standardised. However, the current prices of mRNA vaccines are prohibitive for low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, new manufacturing strategies must be sought to achieve lower production costs making these vaccines affordable to all!
 
 Who you will be working with
 You will work in a vibrant Department, and more specifically in a multi-cultural group that has expertise in microfluidics, device design and fabrication and biocatalysis (besides cell culture). There are several projects underway that tackle different aspects of the mRNA manufacturing process (production and purification).
 
 What you will be doing
 You will be learning device fabrication, how to perform analytical system-wide integration, and mRNA vaccine manufacturing (from operating reactors to perform purifications). You will be creating the key step towards the implementation of continuous platforms for the production of mRNA, enabling on-demand production, and testing the advances you made with cutting-edge analytical methods. 
 
 Who we are looking for
 We are looking for you! A motivated, self-reliant engineer who already has some fabrication and/or biocatalysis experience or is willing to learn corresponding techniques and wants to obtain a foundation suitable for later academic or industrial career.
