Project Summary:

As is well known, the Universe should not exist in its present matter-dominated form. Our current understanding of physics is largely encapsulated by the Standard Model, which tells us that after the Big Bang equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been produced. However, we find ourselves in a Universe almost completely devoid of antimatter, a situation for which there currently is no satisfactory explanation. If you find this situation intolerable and would like to try and do something about it, then this may be the opportunity for you. There is an opening for a PhD student to work in the groups of Professors David Cassidy and Stephen Hogan on topics related to gravity measurements via matter-wave interferometry of helium and positronium atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. The main areas of research involve the design and construction of a new (anti)matter-wave interferometer for use in experiments with helium and positronium Rydberg atoms and the application of this matter-wave interferometer to first measurements of acceleration due to gravity with samples in high Rydberg states. This project is supported by EPSRC and STFC under the Quantum Technologies for Fundamental Physics Programme.
