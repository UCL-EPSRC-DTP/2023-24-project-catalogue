Project Summary:

Digital pathology is a rapidly developing field and technology in diagnostics. In many digital pathology applications deep learning techniques are used to exploit diagnostically relevant morphological features in order to classify normal or cancerous samples. Raman Spectroscopy (RS) is a technology that determines the chemical composition of materials, including tissue samples and can discriminate between cancerous and normal tissues based on their biochemical composition. In this project we aim to expand the reach of digital pathology to encompass a fusion of tissue spatial micro-anatomical detail with Raman spectral imaging and deep learning approaches to create a proof of concept demonstration of its power to better classify and diagnose cancer than either technique alone. The ultimate aim is to deliver a transformative technology that will support the introduction of Raman imaging into routine pathology use in the UK and abroad.
