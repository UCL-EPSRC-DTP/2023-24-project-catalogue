Project Summary:

Hearing impairment is one of the most common and most influential disabilities worldwide, affecting more than 300 million people, and 10.1 million in the UK. The cochlear implant (IC) is a specific auditory prosthesis that is currently the sole clinical treatment for the hearing loss in children and adults who donâ€™t receive sufficient benefit from a standard hearing aid. IC is a device that bypasses the damaged hair cells by generating the electric current in response to the acoustic sound. Despite their successes, CIs remain an imperfect device. Patients are unable to perceive tonal language, appreciate music and discern speech in noisy atmospheres due to a limited range of electrode channels (
