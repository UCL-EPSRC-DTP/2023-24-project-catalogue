Project Summary:

The world needs more sensitive & versatile diagnostic technologies. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is an exceptionally sensitive technique for detecting chemicals as they approach metallic surfaces. These surfaces are nanostructured enabling SERS measurements in exquisite detail of the chemical nature of biologically complex samples as they approach. A critical bottleneck it its wider implementation, however, is in the development of SERS surfaces for use in such analysis where there is rarely a one-size fits all surface. To detect specific analytes of interest or panels of biomarkers, a bespoke surface is often required whose production typically relies on clean-room facilities or commercially availability creating a time/cost bottleneck to high throughput studies. We propose a high-throughput droplet printing strategy for low-cost, array-based sensors. Such a tool would enable a rapid build, discover, apply cycle of new surface coatings tailored to certain biological systems with a cheap route to manufacture. Thereâ€™s also scope to minimise the effects of high variability in SERS response through the incorporating standards and replicates while simultaneously probing large parameter spaces for substrate optimisation (e.g chemistry/formation). 
 
 The project builds upon our existing expertise in array-based SERS techniques & multivariate data analytics for probing biologically complex systems and incorporates our experience in paper-based biosensor development. The project will involve the development & characterisation of advanced surfaces, plasmonic nanoparticles, use of liquid handling robotics and laser optics to analyse biological samples with highly multiplexed substrate-sample interactions. The project is multidisciplinary in nature and would benefit from a student with a background in Physics or Engineering and ideally an understanding of spectroscopy. The student will work primarily within the London Centre for Nanotechnology with Dr. Michael Thomas (https://www.thethomaslab.com) as well as the Dept. for Biochemical Engineering with Dr. Stephen Goldrick (https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=SGOLD17) and link to Dr. Mads Bergholt (Kings College London, https://www.bergholtlab.com).
